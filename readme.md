redirecting user to about page on auth state change is creating an infinate loop

working on migrating the quotes page into a custom HTML element

form and page now working as separate components
need to get the transition into the quotes page after auth working

also need to remove the event listener when navigating away from the pills page or any event listerner installed on components

might want to the change the quoteLi from a web component to a custom element
