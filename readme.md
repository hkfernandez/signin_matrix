keep working on setting header value for signed in user and using it to setup UI

form and page now working as separate components
need to get the transition into the quotes page after auth working

also need to remove the event listener when navigating away from the pills page or any event listerner installed on components

might want to the change the quoteLi from a web component to a custom element
